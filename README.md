##   I developed the MonkeyFinder app, which helps you find monkeys nearby using GPS. When you open the app, you'll see a list of monkeys neatly arranged on the screen. If you tap on one of them, you'll get all the interesting details about that particular monkey.


##   We've implemented the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to ensure code robustness and maintainability. Asynchronous methods are utilized for efficient data retrieval from external APIs.

##   MonkeyFinder offers a versatile user interface, featuring both light and dark themes for consistent visuals across platforms. Screenshots are available for a visual preview
